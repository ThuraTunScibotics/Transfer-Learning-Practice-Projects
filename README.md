# Transfer-Learning-Practice
This notebook is about implementation of identifiying the breed of dog by transfer learning using MobileNetV2. The whole end-to-end multi-class image classifier is implemented with TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlowHub.
The dataset that is used for this is from Kaggle dog-breed-identification competition, please check the link: https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
We have to predict the probabilities for each image of different breed in the test set. We can also predict on our own custom image.
